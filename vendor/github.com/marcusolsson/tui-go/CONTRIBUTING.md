# Contributing

If you're using tui-go for your application, please let me know what works well for you, and especially what doesn't (bug reports are greatly appreciated!).

Pull requests are very much welcome! Check out the current issues to find out how you can help. If you do find anything interesting, please assign yourself to that issue so that others know you're working on it. If you want to contribute a feature not currently not listed, please create a new issue with a description of what you want to do.

Please post any feature requests you might have. Smaller requests might end up being implemented rather quickly and larger ones will be considered for the road map.
